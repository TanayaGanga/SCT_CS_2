Here's a straightforward Python script for image encryption using pixel manipulation with the Pillow library. Be sure to install Pillow first if you havenâ€™t already by running: pip install pillow. This script applies basic encryption and decryption techniques by manipulating pixel values, such as swapping pixels or using simple mathematical operations. Feel free to customize the method or experiment with additional pixel manipulation techniques for stronger encryption.
